# MARTEMIS: _Mars Architecture Research using Taguchi Experiments on the Moon with International Solidarity_

Welcome to project MARTEMIS! In this repository, you'll find all the Solidworks CAD models developed for the report submitted to NASA's [RASC-AL](https://rascal.nianet.org/) competition. CAD models are available in the [CAD Files](https://github.com/andyeske/MARTEMIS/tree/main/CAD%20Files) folder, while all renders can be found on the [Renders](https://github.com/andyeske/MARTEMIS/tree/main/Renders) folder. The habitat layout assembly can be downloaded from the following [folder](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/andyeske_mit_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?login_hint=andyeske%40mit%2Eedu&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fandyeske%5Fmit%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FAndy%20MIT%2FMiscellaneous%2FMARTEMIS&view=0).
