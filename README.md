# MARTEMIS: _Mars Architecture Research using Taguchi Experiments on the Moon with International Solidarity_

Welcome to project MARTEMIS! In this repository, you'll find all the Solidworks CAD models developed for the report submitted to NASA's [RASC-AL](https://rascal.nianet.org/) competition. Individual CAD models are available in the [CAD Files](https://github.com/andyeske/MARTEMIS/tree/main/CAD%20Files) folder, while the habitat layout assembly can be downloaded from the following [folder](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/andyeske_mit_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?login_hint=andyeske%40mit%2Eedu&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fandyeske%5Fmit%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FAndy%20MIT%2FMiscellaneous%2FMARTEMIS&view=0).

### 1: 1400s Modules

**Description:** Main lunar habitat module, inspired largely by Sierra Aerospace's [LIFE 1400](https://www.sierraspace.com/commercial-space-stations/life-space-habitat/) design (hence, the name of the module!). 

**CAD Model Name:** 1400.SLDPRT (Main Module), 1400_interior_v1.SLDPRT (Cross sectional view with open walls), 1400_interior_v2.SLDPRT (Cross sectional view with closed walls), 1400_interior_v3.SLDPRT (the model with the furniture and 3 bedrooms, within the 1400_interior.zip file located in the following [folder](https://mitprod-my.sharepoint.com/personal/andyeske_mit_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?login_hint=andyeske%40mit%2Eedu&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fandyeske%5Fmit%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FAndy%20MIT%2FMiscellaneous%2FMARTEMIS&view=0)).

### 2: Module Joints

**Description:** Joint connector for the 1400s Modules, in the shape of a "+". Each connector can accomodate up to 4 modules (and/or airlocks), although the design can be easily modified to accomodate for an arbitrary number of connections.

**CAD Model Name:** Joint 2.SLDPRT.

### 3: Airlocks

**Description:** Airlock attachments to the 1400s Modules and/or Module Joints. Two airlock variants were designed: one with a staircase leading to the lunar surface, and one with a ramp, to allow for direct connection to the Lunar cruiser vehicle. The main airlock design was inspired largely by that featured in the following [paper](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20210020897/downloads/A%20Multi%20Functional%20Two%20Chamber%20Airlock%20Node%20for%20a%20Common%20Habitat%20Architecture.pdf).

**CAD Model Name:** Airlock.SLDPRT (staircase model) and Airlock_v2.SLDPRT (ramp model).

### 4: Reactors

**Description:** Fission Surface Power Reactors, that provide power for the lunar habitat. The reactor design was modeled after the concepts put forth by [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/tdm/fission-surface-power/) and the [US Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/5-things-you-need-know-about-fission-surface-power-systems).

**CAD Model Name:** Reactor Farm.SLDPRT.

### 5: Lunar Cruiser

**Description:** Lunar cruiser, main vehicle for all-purpose missions on the moon. The vehicle's design replicates [Toyota](https://www.toyota-europe.com/news/2023/lunar-cruiser)'s, which is set to be ready for operation in 2029.

**CAD Model Name:** Cruiser.SLDPRT.

### 6: Starship

**Description:** Starship, main transit vehicle. As the name implies, the rocket's design was modeled after [SpaceX](https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/starship/)'s starship, which is currently under development and testing. The following [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fC96-rWTtI8) provides an overview of the vehicle's modeling in Solidworks.

**CAD Model Name:** Starship.SLDPRT.

### 7: Habitat Layout

**Description:** Finally, the final layout of the lunar habitat can be seen below, which integrates all of the individual components described above. The main layout consists of 17 1400s Modules, 8 Module Joints, 9 Airlocks (6 staircase models, 3 ramp models), and 1 reactor farm. 

**CAD Model Name:** Layout 2.SLDASM.
